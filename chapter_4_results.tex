\section{Water Year 2019} 
\subsection{Thermocouple Array}
The instrument was installed and fully operational on November 16, 2018 and collected continuous temperature measurements for the whole season. Some challenges from this winter included: (i) sagging of the support cables, (ii) snow bridging between vertical steel supports causing a deeper snow profile, (iii) snow depths exceeded the height of our uppermost sensor, (iv) some thermocouples are functioning intermittently after the major snowfall in February, and (iv) channelized/irregular melt patterns around the structure of the sensor in the spring. Despite the above challenges, this dataset suggests that it is possible to use this instrument as a tool for measuring the temperature profile of a snowpack. 

Throughout the season, as snow accumulates, the settling snowpack applies an increasing downward force on the sensor. As a result, some of the support cables sag a few centimeters. The cables also act as a support for the snowpack, so as the snow settles, there is often an elevated snow surface at the temperature array. This promotes the growth of a snow bridge between the two vertical supports. This bridging effect is observable in this data when comparing the snow depth to the temperature profile.   

Thermocouples buried in the soil and at the ground surface consistently read about 0\textdegree C (Figure \ref{fig:GroundTemp}). Moving up through the snowpack, there is a consistent temperature decrease from the 0\textdegree C ground measurement to air temperature (Figure \ref{fig:Dec1_30_TC}). The array of thermocouples above the snowpack measure the same temperature and have much larger diurnal fluctuation than buried sensors (Figure \ref{fig:Dec_Jan_ImageSC}). The snowpack has a large damping effect on temperature fluctuations which makes it possible to estimate snow depth using the temperature profile. However, the snow bridging is evident in this temperature damping and leads to overestimation of snow depth when using the temperature profile as a metric (\ref{fig:Bridging_Photo} - \ref{fig:Bridging_Heatmap}).

The pink line shows our inferred snow depth based on temperature differences between thermocouples (no temperature difference indicates that the sensors are above the snow surface). The pink line is consistently above the white line, indicating snow bridging.}

Starting December 19th, there is snow accumulation that begins to bury these sensors and the become insulated from the strong diurnal temperature swings.}

The precision and accuracy of this instrument is tested during isothermal conditions in the snowpack. During water year 2019, the snowpack went isothermal around March 31 (Figure \ref{fig:0_135cm_Isothermal}). Following warm storm events in early April that deposited a few inches of snow, peak snowmelt started on April 16. This followed a couple warm storm events that deposited a few inches of snow in early April (Figure \ref{fig:SWE_SNTLPrecip}). The instrument has an uncertainty \isostd \ which is the standard deviation of all the thermocouple measurements during the isothermal snowpack (Figure \ref{fig:IsothermBoxplot} - \ref{fig:Iso_Temp_Hist}). As seen in Figure \ref{fig:IsothermBoxplot}, thermocouples show heterogeneity in recorded temperature. One possible explanation for this is the aged Campbell Scientific AM32 Multiplexors that are used in the 2019 water year. These were later replaced because they failed during the 2019 summer.

\end{figure}

In the beginning of April, each buried thermocouple showed very little daily temperature fluctuations (Figure \ref{fig:DailyTempRange}). Directly after peak snowmelt started, the daily range for each thermocouple increased greatly and in some cases is larger than 1\textdegree C. This increase in temperature fluctuation is likely caused by preferential flow of snowmelt due to the instrument. During the melt season, a channel formed between the two vertical supports creating a depression in the snow surface where the thermocouples are placed. Because the instrument has different thermal properties (e.g. albedo and thermal conductivity), it affects melt rates and characteristics of the snow it is in contact with. It is suspected that the instrument facilitates an increased downward flow of water which creates air pockets around the sensor that affect its ability to accurately measure snow temperature in the spring.

\subsection{Temperature Gradient Analysis}
Avalanche forecasters are primarily interested in the timing and duration of critical temperature gradients in the snowpack. Figure \ref{fig:WY2019_GradMaster} shows temperature gradients in the lowest 20cm throughout the whole period of record. These results suggest that higher than critical temperature gradients persist throughout December 2019, but not subsequently. Figure \ref{fig:WY2019_GradMaster} shows temperature gradients in the upper 25cm during the whole period of record. These results illustrate the high amount of variability in the upper layers of the snowpack. Unlike temperature gradients in the lowest 20cm, the top 25cm continually changes because it is not insulated from the atmosphere. For the whole season, the upper layers continually fluctuate between the two significant types of snow metamorphism; constructive and destructive (Figure \ref{fig:WY2019_GradMaster}). The continuous temperature record provided by the BSTA provides insight to the duration and nature of the temperature profile in the upper 25cm as it fluctuates diurnally. Analysis will now be split into three specific periods: December, February, and late March, as presented in histograms. 

December, 2019: In both the upper 25 cm (Figure \ref{fig:Dec_U25_RDH}) and lower 20 cm (Figure \ref{fig:Dec_L20_RDH}), temperature gradients show a long tail towards negative values, and 50\% of measurements fall within the above-critical range. Cold air temperatures, coupled with a shallow snowpack during December forced above-critical temperature gradients on the snowpack for most of the month. 

February, 2019: The upper 25 cm (Figure \ref{fig:Feb_U25_RDH}) shows a reduced range of temperature gradients, such that only 12\% of measurements fall within the above-critical range. The lower 20cm (Figure \ref{fig:Feb_L20_RDH}) has become nearly isothermal, so that gradients show a very narrow range that cluster slightly below 0\textdegree C. By this point in the season, the lowest 20cm of the snowpack is well insulated; thus, there is little to no temperature gradient. Although the upper portion of the snowpack experiences substantial temperature gradients, they are not persistent because of the diurnal solar cycle. 

Late March, 2019: Warmer air temperatures during march preventent large temperature gradients in the upper 25cm (Figure \ref{fig:Mar_U25_RDH}). Much like the Feburary subset, the lowest 20cm are very insulated and are nearly isothermal at 0 \textdegree C (Figure \ref{fig:Mar_L20_RDH}). This subset displays the snowpack as it progresses towards isothermal conditions. 

In addition to the figures shown here, \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN7P9tpWCRZofzf19t5gqyeo645Kbmsac}{time-lapse movies} (see link in appendix) are a helpful way to visualize how temperature gradients change over time. These movies highlight the depth of diurnal solar radiation input and help provide context that aids in the understanding of these processes.

The uncertainty of this temperature gradient analysis is calculated in MATLAB using a Monte-Carlo Simulation. First, the built in MATLAB function 'randn' is used to produce normally distributed, randomly generated data with a mean of one. This data is then multiplied by the standard deviation of thermocouple measurements during the isothermal snowpack to create a synthetic error distribution with mean of zero and standard deviation of \isostd. This error is added to the first order polynomial best fit for a given temperature gradient, then this whole process is repeated 1,000 times to create normally distributed, synthetic temperature gradient measurements. Results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:MC_Grad}.

\subsection{Stable Water Isotopes}
Early in the season, duplicate snow samples were taken from a single pit, but with ~0.5m horizontal spacing (\ref{fig:Pit_18Dec19}). This resulted in significant differences (up to 50\%) in stable isotopes near the top of the snowpack (\ref{fig:Dec18_Isotopes}). The variation between duplicates was much lower in the bottom of the snowpack. Similar trends are present in each duplicate, just displaced with respect to depth. Later in the season, Mar. 17th, triplicate samples were taken directly adjacent to each other (\ref{fig:Pit_17Mar19}) and the results suggest very little variation between triplicates with a maximum difference of 13\% (\ref{fig:Mar17_Isotopes}).
