This project wouldn't have been possible without the support of my graduate advisory committee, Thomas Othiem, and Pamella Aishlan-Cedillo; the latter two provided critical support throughout the manufacturing and design process, which enabled us to collect such a robust dataset in 2019. I also give thanks to Thomas Black and Charlie Luce, who shared their design for this instrument. This project is unique because it's received input from many agencies, including the Idaho Department of Transportation, USDA-NRCS, USFS, and hydrologists from Boise State. The results are collaboration and the culmination of many years spent in development.
