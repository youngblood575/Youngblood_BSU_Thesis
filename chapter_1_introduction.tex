\chapter{Introduction}
Snow in Idaho serves a critical role not only for recreationists but for the state economy. A majority of irrigated agriculture in Idaho relies on surface water managed by a series of canals and reservoir systems. A majority of this water comes as snow during the winter months and is then stored in reservoirs for use during the growing season. Because of this, water managers in Idaho are actively looking for ways to better predict snowmelt runoff. Also, snow and snowmelt can have significant impacts on infrastructure and transportation throughout the state.  Avalanches in central Idaho cause frequent closures on Idaho State Highway 21 and there is a strong push by local avalanche forecasters to better measure temperature conditions of the snowpack leading up to elevated avalanche hazards. By looking at specific snowpack characteristics, it is possible to gain insight into conditions leading to avalanche hazards, floods caused by rain on snow events, and significant runoff. 

The physical properties of snow play an essential role in avalanche prediction. Under the right conditions, temperature gradients within a snowpack drive vapor migration. As vapor migrates through and out of the snowpack, it changes the snow's microstructure and can lead to a substantial water loss of 15\% - 20\% \citep{hood_williams_cline_1999, marks_dozier_1992, kattelmann_elder_1991}. Continuous monitoring of snowpack temperature gradients is valuable for avalanche forecasting because the development of weak, faceted layers, such as depth hoar, depends on a temperature gradient. The rate at which this process (called kinetic metamorphism) occurs depends on several different factors, including the initial snow characteristics, magnitude and duration of temperature gradients, vapor barriers caused by ice layers, and the snowpack's cold content (see equation \ref{eq:1})\citep{sommerfeld_1970, colbeck1983theory}. Although this is a continuous process that occurs over a wide range of temperature gradients, the critical gradient to produce faceted forms in alpine snow is about 0.1\textdegree C/cm \citep{mcclung_schaerer_2009}. When temperature gradients are less than critical, the snow undergoes primarily equillibrium metamorphism and water molecules move mainly by vapor diffusion to new positions that decrease the surface free energy \citep{sommerfeld_1970}. Thus, equillibrium metamorphism is controlled by surface convexities, and leads to rounding and bonds forming between individual snow grains. Both time and temperature are significant factors in determining the stage of metamorphism. If the snow is very cold, it will change slowly; and if it's close to the freezing point, it can change rapidly. In the case of depth hoar, if the critical temperature gradient no longer persists, the snow will undergo equillibrium metamorphism, which breaks down many of its facets \citep{sommerfeld_1970}.

It is important to consider the thermal conductivity of snow which plays an important role in the transfer of energy within the snowpack. The thermal properties of snow vary with density, microstructure, and temperature \citep{arenson2015physical}. The thermal conductivity of snow ranges from 0.04 to 1 W/m/K over the density range of 100 - 550 $kg/m^3$. Although thermal conductivity varies primarily with density, variations in microstructure and crystal anisotropic orientation can affect it by a factor of two. Figure \ref{fig:ThermalConductivity} shows how effective thermal conductivity increases with snow density. Thermal conductivity variations near ice layers can induce large temperature gradients that lead to faceted, weak layer formation, and can be a significant cause of avalanches \citep{arenson2015physical}. Banner Summit's snowpack rarely forms ice layers because air temperatures remain below 0\textdegree C for the majority of the winter, which prohibits the initial melt required to form an ice layer.

Near Banner Summit in Idaho, a significant concern for avalanche forecasters is in the development of depth hoar. Depth hoar is large-grained, faceted, cup-shaped crystals near the ground and forms because of large temperature gradients within the snowpack \citep{akitaya1974}. Depth hoar most commonly forms in the early season because the snowpack is shallow, and there isn't much snow insulating the lowest layers from the cold atmosphere. The geothermal heat flux keeps the snow-ground interface temperature very close to 0 \textdegree C (Figure \ref{fig:GroundTemp}). This condition combined with a shallow snowpack and cold air temperatures, leads to large sustained temperature gradients in the early season. The duration and magnitude of critical temperature gradients in the lower snowpack is not well monitored, as typically it is measured infrequently during manual snowpit observations; for example the ITD avalanche forecasters measure this gradient once per month.

Dry-snow avalanches are primarily a concern in the early to mid-winter season. As spring approaches, a snowpack temperature profile provides insight into the snowmelt process, and can indicate when wet snow avalanches are possible. There are are three primary phases a snowpack must go through to have considerable melt and runoff: warming, ripening, and output \citep{dingman2015}. Any energy absorbed by the sub-freezing snowpack during the warming phase raises its average temperature until it reaches isothermal conditions at 0\textdegree C \citep{dingman2015}. This energy required to warm a snowpack to isothermal conditions is known as the cold content (Q\textsubscript{cc}) \citep{dingman2015}, and can be calculated directly from the temperature profile:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
Q\textsubscript{cc} = -c\textsubscript{i}*\rho\textsubscript{w}*h\textsubscript{m}*(T\textsubscript{s}-T\textsubscript{m})
\end{equation}

Where c\textsubscript{i} is the heat capacity of ice, T\textsubscript{s} is the average temperature of the snowpack, T\textsubscript{m} is the melting point of ice, $\rho\textsubscript{w}$ is the density of water, and h\textsubscript{m} is the snow water equivalent (SWE). 

Once the snowpack is isothermal, it enters the ripening phase where absorbed energy melts snow, but the meltwater is retained in the snowpack by surface tension forces \citep{dingman2015}. After the snowpack reaches its water holding capacity and it is "ripe," it enters the output phase where further absorption of energy produces water output \citep{dingman2015}. Because isothermal conditions mark the beginning of the ripening phase, it may be possible to predict snowmelt runoff timing more accurately by measuring the snowpack's temperature profile continuously.

Snow is a prime example of the observer effect; the mere observation of a phenomenon within the snowpack inevitably changes the phenomenon. The current method for measuring the temperature profile of a snowpack is a time consuming, destructive process that is not automated. It requires someone to dig a snow pit and manually measure the snow temperature by inserting probes at equal depth intervals. Not only does this disturb the snow profile and change its characteristics, but itâ€™s a snapshot in time, while snow temperature conditions change on an hourly time scale in the upper part of the snowpack, and on a weekly time scale at depth. There is no continuous record of the snowpack temperature profile at Banner Summit and avalanche forecasters with the Idaho Transportation Department are interested in measuring the magnitude and duration of critical temperature gradients in the upper 25cm and lowest 20cm of the snowpack. They perform monthly in-situ snowpits and measure the gradient manually.  

It is important to note that current technology can measure a snowpack temperature profile at a single point in space, rather than the basin scale. Although snowpack conditions can vary widely at the basin scale, the BSTA serves as a valuable tool because it may be possible to build statistical relationships between this site and a nearby basin, or avalanche starting zones. The ability to conduct statistical analysis for avalanche hazards and snowmelt runoff will come only with a continuous record from the BSTA at Banner Summit.  

In this study, we continuously measure the snowpack temperature profile as it changes throughout the winter. This data further develops our understanding of temperature gradient metamorphism in snow, it provides insight into snowpack processes that lead to significant snowmelt, and helps address the following questions: \\
1) What is the duration and magnitude of critical temperature gradients in the upper and lower portions of the snowpack? \\
2) How long do critical temperature gradients persist in the lowest layers of the snowpack? \\
3) Can this data improve snowmelt runoff predictions? 

We also present a continuous snowpack temperature monitoring system, the Banner Summit Thermocouple Array (BSTA) along with methods for analyzing temperature gradient metamorphism and melt. Results suggest this instrument is successful at measuring the temperature profile of a snowpack with an accuracy of \isostd \ (Figure \ref{fig:Iso_Temp_Hist}) and an uncertainty in temperature gradient estimates of \gradstd \ (Figure \ref{fig:MC_Grad}).
