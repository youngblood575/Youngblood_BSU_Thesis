\subsection{Isothermal Snowpack and Runoff Timing}
To generate considerable snowmelt runoff, a snowpack must experience three basic phases - warming, ripening, and output. In an idealized scenario, warming and heat transfer increase the temperature of the entire snowpack to 0 Â°C. At the point where it becomes isothermal, it enters the ripening phase, where any additional absorbed energy causes snow melt. Although absorbed energy melts snow, the majority of melt water is retained in the snowpack via surface tension and continuous pores filled with air, until the snowpack reaches the liquid water holding capacity (~2-5\%) (\cite{dingman2015}). After the snowpack reaches its liquid water holding capacity, it enters the output phase where further absorption of energy produces water output. It is important to note that this is a very idealized sequence. For example, melting often occurs at the surface before the snowpack becomes isothermal and may percolate deeper into the snowpack where it can refreeze and form ice layers. The percolation is also heterogeneous.  Vertical pipes typically form that route water vertically, until larger changes in hydraulic conductivity cause pooling or lateral flow at layer boundaries (\cite{evans2016isotopic, eiriksson2013evaluation}). In addition, latent heat exchange during these phase changes contributes significantly to the overall snowpack energy balance and internal processes. 

The SNOTEL network is currently the most robust system for measuring snowpack characteristics and it creates hourly reports of snow depth, snow water equivelence (SWE), and precipitation across the Western United States. Using snow depth and SWE to calculate snow density, it is possible to estimate when a snowpack has reached ripe conditions. This usually occurs around 400 kg m\textsuperscript{-3} or 40\% density, although this is site dependent and depends on the maximum dry snow density. The current network lacks the ability to measure snowpack temperatures. Therefore it is very hard to predict the beginning of the ripening phase. In a scenario with a lower density snowpack at the beginning of its ripening phase, there are few in situ measurements that provide the data necessary to make predictions on when the snowpack will enter the output phase. Combining data from the SNOTEL network, weather forecasts, and snowpack temperature arrays could provide a means to estimate the timing of the output phase. Below are fundamental equations that could be used to approach this problem. 

From empirical studies, the maximum volumetric water content ($\theta$\textsubscript{ret}) that a snowpack can retain against gravity is defined as: 
\begin{equation}
\theta \textsubscript{ret} = -0.0745\frac{\rho \textsubscript{s}}{\rho \textsubscript{w}}
+ 0.00267\frac{\rho \textsubscript{s}}{\rho \textsubscript{w}}^2 
\end{equation}
Where $\rho \textsubscript{s}$ and $\rho \textsubscript{w}$ are the densities of snow and water respectively. Ripe snowpacks usually have a bulk density of $\rho_s$ = 400 kg m\textsuperscript{-3} and according to the above equation, this leads to a maximum volumetric water content of $\theta$\textsubscript{ret} = 0.03. The net energy (Q\textsubscript{m2}) in J m\textsuperscript{-2} required to complete the ripening phase is defined as: 
\begin{equation}
Q_{m2} = \theta_{ret} * h_s * \rho_w * \lambda_f
\end{equation}
Where h\textsubscript{s} is snow depth and $\lambda_f$ is the latent heat of fusion (0.334 MJ kg\textsuperscript{-1}). 

Using parameters such as weather forecasts, snow albedo, the temperature profile, etc., it is possible to estimate the potential net energy exchange between the snowpack and atmosphere. If there is a net energy exchange into the snow that exceeds Q\textsubscript{m2}, the snowpack will likely enter the output phase.  

Figures \ref{fig:0_135cm_Isothermal} - \ref{fig:0_135cm_Zoom} show snowpack temperature measurements as it reaches isothermal conditions at Banner Summit. Although the beginning of the ripening phase is defined as isothermal conditions at 0\textdegree C, this study interprets isothermal conditions when the range of temperature measurements on the BSTA drops below the estimated accuracy of the temperature probes. The instrument's accuracy dictates this interpretation because, although it's minimal, there is an inherent error in temperature measurements. The minimum temperature range in 2019 is ~0.02 C and occurs on March 31st. This marks the beginning of the ripening phase.

The ability to precisely measure when the snowpack goes isothermal provides context when observing the following melt stages. Figure \ref{fig:SWE_Density} shows snow density and snow water equivalent with an overlay of the interpreted melt stages. Although the snowpack becomes isothermal on March 31st, the liquid water capacity (LWC) is below the max capacity of the snowpack. Between the 31st - April 6th, air temperatures were below freezing, and storms brought fresh snow. During April 7th - 9th, there was rain on snow that increased snow density to $\sim$40\%. Between April 9 - 10, the snowpack lost $\sim$2cm of SWE, marking the beginning of the output phase.    

Using these interpretations at Banner Summit to predict runoff at the basin scale poses several challenges. Perhaps most significantly, measurements at a single point don't characterize the behavior of an entire basin. To establish any relationship between these measurements and nearby streamflow, a more extended period of record is necessary. However, this dataset provides more context when interpreting springtime runoff at a nearby stream gauge. Figure \ref{fig:HydrographPhases} is a hydrograph from the nearby stream gauge with an overlay of the interpreted melt stages at Banner Summit. Shortly after the snowpack reaches the ripening phase on March 31st, streamflow at this gauge departs from normal conditions and is above the median. Additionally, when our study site reaches its output phase, there is a significant increase in streamflow.

\subsection{Temperature Gradient Analysis}
Temperature-gradient metamorphism is the process of vapor transport along a thermal gradient (\cite{sommerfeld_1970}). As long as the gradient is maintained, as is usually the case in cold environments, the process continually acts on the snowpack. The snow characteristics during the beginning of this process have a strong effect on its progress (\cite{sommerfeld_1970}). In new, fine grained, porous snow, there are more grains in which the diffusing vapor can freeze. Consequently, the grains do not grow very large, and hollow pyramids are not common (\cite{sommerfeld_1970}). If temperature-gradient metamorphism starts in larger-grained, equi-temprature metamorphosed snow, there are fewer crystals on which the vapor can freeze. Under a consistent thermal gradient, these crystals will grow larger, and hollow pyramids along with lattice grains may be found (\cite{akitaya_1967}). 

Many different factors affect the rate and nature of temperature-gradient metamorphism, and a continual collection of the snowpack temperature data is critical in understanding these processes. Further work should focus on collecting more frequent snow pit observations to document the rate of change in the snow's microstructure. 

\subsection{Stable Water Isotopes}
 Samples for stable isotope analysis were collected in a lightly forested area with varying amounts of underbrush and fallen trees. This uneven ground creates an inconsistent datum between sampling events and introduces an unexpected amount of spatial variability. In addition to this, the presence of vegitation also affects snow processes via emission of longwave radiation, screening of solar radiation, etc (\cite{beria_larsen_ceperley_michelon_vennemann_schaefli_2017}. Moving forward, sampling for stable water isotopes in snow should be conducted in open areas with an even ground surface that is free of large brush, or fallen debris. If a study is conducted in a forested/lightly forested area, there should be a preseason effort to clear the sampling locations of anything that creates an uneven ground surface. 

Although this dataset does not provide a basis for conclusions that differ from previous studies, there are important trends to note. Figure \ref{fig:WY2019_Isotopes} shows samples taken from three different days accross the season. The $\delta$\textsuperscript{18}O values are more consistent in the lowest portion of the snowpack and diverge upwards.
